Code as 'Yes' if the victim had disclosed suicidal thoughts or plans to another person recently or within the last month, whether explicitly (e.g., 'I have been thinking about suicide lately' or 'I plan to go to my cabin with my gun and never come back') or indirectly (e.g., 'I know how to put a permanent end to this pain'). Include in the narrative any available details about whom the intent was disclosed to, how long before the death the intent was disclosed, and what was said during the disclosure. Code as 'Yes' if there was an opportunity to intervene between the time the person disclosed intent and the injury event. Do not code this variable if the victim disclosed the intention to kill themselves only at the moment of the suicide (i.e., when there was no opportunity to intervene to stop the suicide), such as sending an email or text message right before the victim shot herself, as this would be considered a suicide note. Additionally, do not endorse this variable if the victim had talked about suicide sometime in the distant past but had not recently disclosed a current intent to die by suicide to anyone; this should be coded as 'History of disclosed suicidal thoughts/plans.' A separate suicide attempt by the victim within a month of the suicide should be coded as 'Yes,' and in this case, 'History of suicide attempts' should also be coded as 'Yes.' If the timing of the victim's disclosure of suicidal intent is unclear (e.g., recently or some time ago) or not mentioned, use the following rules to code these cases: code 'Yes' if the narrative states the victim 'just' or 'recently' told someone about their suicidal intent; if the record indicates disclosure of intent but is unclear about the timeframe (i.e., does not mention it at all), code as 'Yes.' However, if law enforcement or coroner/medical examiner reports indicate disclosure of intent in the past but state that there was no disclosure for the current incident, code this as 'No.'\"\n",
